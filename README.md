# Advanced-Algorithms-and-Datastructures
Some task completed to further the users knowledge on different core computer science aspects such as algorithms, datastructures and complexity.

The tasks includes 5 labs, 2 master exams and 2 practice master exams

Labs:
- lab1: This practices the users ability to program after a function specification
- lab2: This tests the user on how to reprogram an already existing program to execute more efficiently
- lab3: Lets the user program after a detailet algorithmic specification
- lab4: Practice working with reductions and finding suitable algorithms to reduce from
- lab5: Attacking problems that cant be solved in an optimal way
